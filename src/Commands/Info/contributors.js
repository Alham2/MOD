However, the code had become outdated, prompting me (PHV) to completely recode the entire project. I have also added numerous additional features such as meme, welcome, ping, github, covid, etc. It has come to my attention that some individuals have accused me of simply stealing this code. I want to clarify that I have diligently rectified any errors, extensively updated the entire codebase (which took me days to accomplish), and made several significant improvements. Therefore, I kindly request that you refrain from making unfounded assumptions.'
